# Strix
Testing Exercises
## Exercise 1
### Introduction:
This exerecise was cretaed with the help of **Postman** The collection and environment files are availabie in the Strix/Exercise1 path.
### Assumptions/Limitations:
- API Test were based on the acutal behaviour and not based on the (grapql,rest) requriement, defintions
- Some of the requests to searchnode.net were not included - assumed not to be part of the critical path
- API Test doesnt contain shopping as a looged in user
- API Test is using a single product and one store details for a test data. Both were chosen to limit the likelihood of false positive, still it may cause some issues during execution (eg. no product in the warehouse, store closed)
- API Test has some space for improvement in terms of time of execution (are all request neccessary?) and some assertions (regex in the body response). For this some pairing is adivesed before sending to the monitoring
- For the API Test, the query_key has been parametrized and hardcoded.It supposed to be geneerated based on the given api specification 

### Scope of the API test
- Home Page (castorama.pl)
  - getToHomePage
- Product Search
  - searchProduct
  - getProductDetails
  - displayProduct
- Create Cart
  - createEmptyCart
  - addProductToCart
  - getMarkets
  - getProductStatusStore
  - getStoreDetails
  - fetchCart
  - fetchCartAvailableStores
- Cart Checkout
  - getCountries
  - fetchCartForCheckout
  - getCountryPhones
  - getZipCodes
  - setShippingAddressesOnCart
  - setGuestEmailOnCart
  - setShippingMethodsOnCart
  - setPaymentMethod
  - setBillingAddressOnCart
### Execution time
The average execution time for the above scope 11-12s 

### Running via CI
Follow the [guide](https://learning.postman.com/docs/running-collections/using-newman-cli/continuous-integration/),
you should end up in a similar commands as below:
```
newman run https://api.getpostman.com/collections/{{collection_uid}}?apikey={{postman-api-key-here}}
--environment https://api.getpostman.com/environments/{{environment_uid}}?apikey={{postman-api-key-here}}
```
### Frequency of execution
Every 5 minutes / per country region


## Exercise 2
### Introduction
The exercise was performed following the below flow:
1. Functional Analysis of the page using [mindmap](https://coggle.it/diagram/YrYu8LndxQl8MoIF/t/semilac-pl)
2. Analysis of the User Flows and prioritisation - [priority tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YTQLFPOZr83975LFVXIoEw5UtAZLwy5arq4D67wmeYM/edit?usp=sharing)
3. Designing the scope of the Pages need for test automation - [page objects](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YTQLFPOZr83975LFVXIoEw5UtAZLwy5arq4D67wmeYM/edit#gid=968477189)
4. Selecting the Test Automation tool: Cypress 9.2 (the latest version 10 is not supported by Browserstack)
5. Design of the Page Objects  (Cypress/JS)
6. Design of the Test Script (Cypress/JS)
### Assumptions/Limitations
- The example test is not completed, contains full design for 2 out 7 steps
- The test was designed using Cypress 9.2
- The biggest not solved challanges are:
  - timinig issue when opening search field. Regardless fact that cypresss has it's own waiting mechanism, only explicit wait helps in typing in the search field locally. For the Browserstack this issue still persists. 
**[Update]** This is now fixed, details in the [PR](https://github.com/AleeTesting/Strix/pull/1)
  - Issues when adding product to basket. It seems there is unknow background activty that prevents from adding a product to basket using Cypress, the button stuck on "Dodaje/Adding". This should be cross refferenced with other tool (eg.Webdriver)to find out if this is a Cypress issue only
- The automated test were designed to support different leanguages, however this shall be further analyzed. The web page for different leanguags,  contatins a slitghly different UI. To cover every scenario, dedicated logic needs to be implemented. This will eventaully make the test automated scrtips unnecesserly complex
- The execution of the 2 out of 7 steps, is already consuming 30-40 seconds, which indicates that the full test script will take aroung 2-3 minutes.
- For the readeability aspect, the spec description in Cypress should be good eneough. No gherkin strucutre is recommended, as the efort for additional layer of abstraction doesn't compensate the potential gain and usually little interest in tests/automation from the Business side.
### Scope of the example test
- Order product as guest user (polish)
  - should be able to find a product
  - should be able to open a product
  - should be able to add product to cart
  - should be able to checkout cart
  - should be able to order as a guest
  - should be able to enter delivery address
  - should be able to selct payment

## Exercise 3
### Introduction
The execution of the test was planned on the docker and predefined image comming from Cypress. Thanks to this image it is possible to [run Cypress with a single Docker command](https://www.cypress.io/blog/2019/05/02/run-cypress-with-a-single-docker-command/)
```
docker run -it -v $PWD:/e2e -w /e2e cypress/included:9.7.0
```
or using the docker config file

```
docker build -t cypress-test-image:1.0.0 -f dockerfile .
```

Unfortunately with my device (M1chip), I encoutnbered an issue for (both approaches), that I couldn't quickly resolve:
```
lipskia@Aleksanders-MacBook-Pro Exercise_2 % docker run --platform linux/amd64 -it -v $PWD:/e2e -w /e2e cypress/included:9.7.0
qemu: uncaught target signal 5 (Trace/breakpoint trap) - core dumped
qemu: uncaught target signal 5 (Trace/breakpoint trap) - core dumped
qemu: uncaught target signal 11 (Segmentation fault) - core dumped
The Test Runner unexpectedly exited via a exit event with signal SIGSEGV

Please search Cypress documentation for possible solutions:

Check if there is a GitHub issue describing this crash:

Consider opening a new issue.

### Assumptions/Limitations:
- The execution via BrowserStack shows that there is still a timing issue for the Chrome browsers when trying to open search field **[Update]** This is now fixed, details in the [PR](https://github.com/AleeTesting/Strix/pull/1)
